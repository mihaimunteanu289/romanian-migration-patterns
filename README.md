<h1>Romanian Migration Patterns</h1>
This repository contains the source code for a project that uses statistical and machine learning models to predict emigration patterns in Romanian counties.

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
The goal of this project is to use data science techniques to predict migration patterns in Romanian counties. The approach employed here is based on exploratory data analysis, data aggregation, statistical modeling, machine learning modeling, and counties clustering. 

The entire project is divided into multiple Jupyter notebooks each detailing a step in the pipeline from data exploration to model training.

<h2>Repository Structure</h2>
Here is a brief explanation of what each part of this repository covers:

<ul>
    <li><b>data:</b> Contains the input files for the project as well as the generated files after data processing.</li>
    <li><b>parameters:</b> Contains files related to the hyperparameters for the machine learning models.</li>
    <li><b>1. exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb:</b> This notebook includes initial analysis of the data, including data cleaning and preprocessing.</li>
    <li><b>2. data_aggregation.ipynb:</b> This notebook deals with aggregating data into useful subsets for analysis.</li>
    <li><b>3. statistical_ml_modeling.ipynb:</b> In this notebook, statistical modeling is used to understand the data and guide the creation of machine learning models.</li>
    <li><b>4. ml_modeling.ipynb:</b> This notebook includes the process of creating, training, and validating machine learning models using the processed data.</li>
    <li><b>5. counties_clustering.ipynb:</b> This notebook includes the process of clustering counties based on migration patterns.</li>
    <li><b>README.md:</b> The file that provides an overview of the project and the repository.</li>
</ul>
